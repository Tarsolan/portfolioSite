## Portfolio Page

My first official webpage. I put this online using a combination of AWS Route 53, AWS ACM, an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, and AWS Amplify. This site is an excellent showcase of my ability to learn and implement cloud-based features using AWS, as well as my skills with React development.
